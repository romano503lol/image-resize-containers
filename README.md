## Overview
Image Resize Containers is a simple yet powerful solution for resizing images using Cloudflare Workers. This repository provides a lightweight framework that allows you to handle image processing efficiently. By leveraging the capabilities of Cloudflare, you can scale your image processing tasks seamlessly.

## Features
- Fast image resizing with minimal latency.
- Scalable architecture using Cloudflare Workers.
- Simple API for easy integration.
- Support for multiple image formats.
- Type generation for better development experience.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies. Use the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/romano503lol/image-resize-containers.git
cd image-resize-containers
npm install
```

## Usage
After installing the dependencies, you can run the development server. This allows you to test the application locally.

```bash
npm run dev
```

To deploy your application to production, use:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

## Development
During development, you might want to generate or synchronize types based on your Worker configuration. You can do this with the following command:

```bash
npm run cf-typegen
```

When instantiating `Hono`, make sure to pass `CloudflareBindings` as generics:

```typescript
// src/index.ts
const app = new Hono<{ Bindings: CloudflareBindings }>()
```

## Deployment
Deploying your application is straightforward. Ensure you have the necessary configurations set up in your Cloudflare dashboard. After that, run the deploy command to push your changes live.

```bash
npm run deploy
```

## Type Generation
For generating or synchronizing types based on your Worker configuration, run the following command:

```bash
npm run cf-typegen
```

This step is crucial for ensuring type safety in your application. It helps you avoid runtime errors by catching issues during development.
